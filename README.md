Python Calculator App!

This is a python app that should have no requirements when it comes to hardware, just make sure the latest version of python is installed.

To use this calculator wait for the prompting statement "Evaluate:" This is where you will put in your expression to be evaluated! 
Some things to remember:
*The Enter Key is your equals sign (=)! Placing an equals sign will result in an error statement (not a program crash)...
*After hitting the enter key, your expression will be evaluated, if it cannot be evaluated you will receive an error message. 
*The pi symbol is not accounted for in this program version, so putting in "pi" will result in an error message
*the following arithmetic functions can be used: cos(),sin(),tan(),log() [base 10 only], ln(). 
  *there is a short cut for these if you wish to save time: c,s,t,l,n, respectively
    *example: inputting c0 is equivalent to inputting cos(0)
    **note: inputting c0+6 is not the same as inputting cos(0+6) [if you wish to evaluate an expression inside a cos() function correctly, you must use cos(expression)]
